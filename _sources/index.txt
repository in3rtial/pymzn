PyMzn
=====

Welcome to the documentation of the PyMzn project.

PyMzn is a Python library that wraps and enhances the
`MiniZinc <http://minzinc.org>`__ tools for CSP modelling and solving.
It is built on top of the libminizinc library (version 2.0)
and provides a number of off-the-shelf functions to readily solve problems
encoded in MiniZinc and parse the solutions into Python objects.
