Quick Start
===========
First, you need a MiniZinc model encoding the problem you want to solve.
Here is a simple 0-1 knapsack problem encoded with MiniZinc:

::

    %% test.mzn %%
    int: n;  % number of objects
    set of int: OBJ = 1..n;
    int: capacity;  % the capacity of the knapsack
    array[OBJ] of int: profit;  % the profit of each object
    array[OBJ] of int: size;  % the size of each object

    var set of OBJ: x;
    constraint sum(i in x)(size[i]) <= capacity;
    var int: obj = sum(i in x)(profit[i]);
    solve maximize obj;


    %% test.dzn %%
    n = 5;
    profit = [10, 3, 9, 4, 8];
    size = [14, 4, 10, 6, 9];

You can solve the above problem using the ``pymzn.minizinc`` function:
::

    import pymzn
    pymzn.minizinc('test.mzn', 'test.dzn', data={'capacity': 20})

The result will be:
::

    [{'x': {3, 5}}]

The ``minizinc`` function returns a list of solutions. The default
behavior is to evaluate the solutions into python objects. Solutions are
dictionaries containing variable assignments. The returned variables
are, by default, the 'free' variables, i.e. those that do not depend on
other variables. If you are interested in the value of other variables
for each solution you can specify the ``output_vars`` argument:

::

    pymzn.minizinc('test.mzn', output_vars=['x', 'obj'])

This will override the default behavior so, if you are still interested
in the default set of variables, you need to specify them as well.

The evaluation of the solutions by PyMzn uses an internal output
representation (actually dzn format) specified as an output statement
that overrides the one specified in the model if any (though the
original output statement in your model is left untouched, more details
on how PyMzn works internally are available in the documentation).

If you wish to override the default behavior and get as output strings
formatted with your original output statement you can use the
``raw_output`` argument:

::

    pymzn.minizinc('test.mzn', raw_output=True)

This will disable the automatic parsing, so the ``output_vars`` will be
ignored if specified.

Data
----

It is possible to specify data (.dzn) files to the ``minizinc`` function
as additional positional arguments:

::

    pymzn.minizinc('test.mzn', 'data1.dzn', 'data2.dzn')

It is also possible to specify additional data inline with the
``minizinc`` function:

::

    pymzn.minizinc('test.mzn', 'data1.dzn', 'data2.dzn', data={'n': 10, 'm': [1,3,5]})

With the ``data`` argument you can specify an assignment of variables
that will be automatically converted to dzn format with the
``pymzn.dzn`` function (more details in the `Dzn files <reference/dzn/>`__
section).

Solver's arguments
------------------

Usually, solvers provide arguments that can be used to modify their
behavior. You can specify arguments to pass to the solver as additional
keyword arguments in the ``minizinc`` function. For instance, using the
argument ``time`` for Gecode, it will set a time cut-off (in
milliseconds) for the problem solving:

::

    pymzn.minizinc('test.mzn', time=30000)  # 30 seconds cut-off

Adding the ``parallel`` argument, you can specify how many threads
should Gecode use for the problem solving:

::

    pymzn.minizinc('test.mzn', time=30000, parallel=0)  # 0 = number of available CPU cores

More details on available options are in the `Solvers <reference/solvers/>`__
section.
