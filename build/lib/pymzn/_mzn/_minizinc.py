"""
PyMzn provides functions that mimic and enhance the tools from the libminizinc
library. With these tools, it is possible to compile a MiniZinc model into
FlatZinc, solve a given problem and get the output solutions directly into the
python code.

The main function that PyMzn provides is the ``minizinc`` function, which
executes the entire workflow for solving a CSP problem encoded in MiniZinc.
Solving a MiniZinc problem with PyMzn is as simple as:
::

    import pymzn
    pymzn.minizinc('test.mzn')

The ``minizinc`` function is probably the way to go for most of the problems,
but the ``mzn2fzn`` and ``solns2out`` functions are in the public API to allow
for maximum flexibility. The latter two functions are wrappers of the two
homonym MiniZinc tools for, respectively, converting a MiniZinc model into a
FlatZinc one and getting custom output from the solution stream of a solver.

Serialization
-------------

Another important aspect that PyMzn addresses is the "isolation" of
solving instances of a problem. This problem arises when there are
multiple solving instances of the same problem file running in parallel.
This is especially important when the problems are continuously solved
in separate threads. PyMzn can be set to make sure that the instances do
not interfere with each other, by setting the argument
``serialize=True`` in the ``minizinc`` function. For instance:

::

    import threading

    solutions = {}

    def solve(n):
        solutions[n] = pymzn.minizinc('test.mzn', data={'n': n}, serialize=True)

    for n in range(10):
        threading.Thread(target=solve, args=(n,)).start()

Setting ``serialize=True`` in each solving instance will prevent all the
instances from interfering with each other.

    Main function of the library.
    It implements the workflow to solve a constrained optimization problem
    encoded with MiniZinc. It first calls mzn2fzn to compile the fzn and ozn
    files, then it calls the provided solver and in the end it calls the
    solns2out utility on the output of the solver.

    :param str or MinizincModel mzn: The minizinc problem to be solved.
                                     It can be either a string or an
                                     instance of MinizincModel.
                                     If it is a string, it can be either the
                                     path to the mzn file or the content of
                                     the model.
    :param dzn_files: A list of paths to dzn files to attach to the mzn2fzn
                      execution, provided as positional arguments; by default
                      no data file is attached. Data files are meant to be
                      used when there is data that is static across several
                      minizinc executions.
    :param dict data: Additional data as a dictionary of variables assignments
                      to supply to the mzn2fnz function. The dictionary is
                      then automatically converted to dzn format by the
                      pymzn.dzn function. This property is meant to include
                      data that dynamically changes across several minizinc
                      executions.
    :param bool keep: Whether to keep the generated mzn, fzn and
                      ozn files o not. Notice though that pymzn generated
                      files are not originally intended to be kept, but this
                      property can be used for debugging purpose.
                      Default is False.
    :param str output_base: The base name (including parent directories if
                            different from the working one) for the output
                            mzn, fzn and ozn files (extension are attached
                            automatically). Parent directories are not
                            created automatically so they are required to
                            exist. If None is provided (default) the name of
                            the input file is used. If the mzn input was a
                            content string, then the default name 'mznout'
                            is used.
    :param bool serialize: Whether to serialize the current workflow or not.
                           A serialized execution generates a series of mzn
                           files that do not interfere with each other,
                           thereby providing isolation of the executions.
                           This property is especially important when solving
                           multiple instances of the problem on separate
                           threads. Notice though that this attribute will
                           only guarantee the serialization of the generated
                           files, thus it will not guarantee the serialization
                           of the solving procedure and solution retrieval.
                           The default is False.
    :param bool raw_output: The default value is False. When this argument
                            is False, the output of this function is a list
                            of evaluated solutions. Otherwise, the output is
                            a list of strings containing the solutions
                            formatted according to the original output
                            statement of the model.
    :param [str] output_vars: The list of output variables. If not provided,
                              the default list is the list of free variables
                              in the model, i.e. those variables that are
                              declared but not defined in the model.
                              This argument is only used when raw_output
                              is True.
    :param str mzn_globals_dir: The name of the directory where to search
                                for global included files in the standard
                                library; by default the 'gecode' global
                                library is used, since Pymzn assumes Gecode
                                as default solver
    :param func fzn_fn: The function to call for the solver; defaults to
                        the function pymzn.gecode
    :param dict fzn_args: A dictionary containing the additional arguments
                          to pass to the fzn_fn, provided as additional
                          keyword arguments to this function
    :return: Returns a list of solutions. If raw_input is True,
             the solutions are strings as returned from the solns2out
             function. Otherwise they are returned as dictionaries of
             variable assignments, and the values are evaluated.
